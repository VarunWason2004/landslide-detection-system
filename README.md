# esp32-landslide-detection-system
An IoT-based ESP32 project for landslide detection using DHT11, soil moisture, and vibration sensors with a buzzer alarm. The ESP32 collects environmental data and serves it as JSON over Wi-Fi, while a Python interface monitors readings in real time and provides early warning alerts for potential landslides.
